Deploy notes for Render:
- Use Python 3 environment.
- Build command: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Start command: gunicorn recipes_project.wsgi
- Set environment variables if you change SECRET_KEY or DEBUG.
- For media (uploaded images) use external storage (S3 or Cloudinary). Render's ephemeral filesystem is not suitable for persistent media.
